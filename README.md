## Work Log:

### Initial Steps:
I don't know what I'll make this page about, but I figure I can do that last if I do this right. I've tried making webpages before with html and css, but I never liked how they came out. I always tried to do all the parts cohesively, but this time I wanted to try a different method.

I've been messing around with flask for a little while (no live sites, just following Miguel Grinberg's tutorial) Which led me to learn about templates & and how those can be used to integrate individual parts. So, I am following a similar method. My plan is to first do layouts and content types. which will be a set of templates. 1 main style site and many different content sections of various types that can be used and reused depending on the situation.

### Layout and content types:

I added several content types: content-post, content-img, content-text, content-table, content-text-table, content-img-list, and content-img-text. I think thats good for layout. It covers the whole list of general requirements. 

Next, I am going to get the spacing and fonts down. I'll use the Sass variables for that. Then I'll do coloring with Sass variables as well. Finally, I'll break out the pages from the parts I've conceived (hopefully, I'll have a good idea for a topic at that point.) 

Then, I will add the actual content. Paragraphs, images, and that jazz. I am leaving printing, last. I'll use that to satisfy the media query requirements as bootstrap satisfies the responsiveness and I don't want to "find" a reason to use the media queries. 

### Layout, Colors, and Fonts

I've started out with figuring out how to add the Css file correctly into the html locally. I'll adjust it for the github pages last. 

Then I added SCSS and started to figure out how to address each element I want to style: content classes, header/footer, title, etc.

I added a border around each content type to begin figuring out layout & spacing for each style. As it is, I actually satisfy most of the requirements, but I want to be proud of this.

I finally got the spacing and layout. I'm not going to mess around with fonts. I really really don't know how to pick them. I also set up the color styling in a way I like. 

Its really coming together

### Pages
This was quick. I made a few pages: index, past, present, future. I think I'll just add some info about me. 


### Content

Added the content. Hells yeah.
